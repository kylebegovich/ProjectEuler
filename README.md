The problems for Project Euler I have solved.
Website here: https://projecteuler.net/

## Python
These are generally very straightforward to undertand / interpret, and make great use of the math library import

## Java
Just getting started with solving the problems in Java. Not a beginner to Java, but just starting this project now
